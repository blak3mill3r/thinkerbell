  * activation buffer for each vertex in current training phase (one is the original examples)
  * weight buffer for each edge in current training phase
  * weight scratch buffer for the last edge in current training phase
  trickiness: need separate temp memory space for each branch of tree

  create a map while doing this map<Vertex,int> vertex one down from a fork
  * starting from the one and only vertex with 0 out edges as required by the training algorithm
    * z=max(z, space required for neuron temporary values for this vertex
    * if forkinttheroad
      * z=max(z, sum of the size requirements of the n downstream paths
    * else
      * go down one
      * if nowhere to go, store size req in map at the vertex directly under the last fork or the top

  now the map contains sizes for the things which will have to coexist in temporary memory

  need an abstraction of "step" so device pointers into temp memory can be assigned to them

  create a map that contains ptrs into temporary memory for each step
  * starting from the only vertex with 0 out edges
    * if forkintheroad
      * make pointers to separate space for each vertex with sizes from the map above^ 
    * else the memory space is all ours at this point


maybe more better than that, along the lines of
step through the training process in a prep phase first
and "dynamically" allocating temp memory for whatever is needed
therefore discarding the idea of 2 buffers for each of 3 phases
there's just a single space * 3 phases
just big enough for whatever needs to fit in at the same time

this actually seems to simplify it

step through the edges in topo order of their targets
  if I'm the only edge activating my target
    use the kernel that reads and adds to result's values rather than overwriting
  activate the target...

dynamic mem allocator
  pseudo-dynamic, it is merely prepping pointers into temp memory and ensuring space requirements
  so you can allocate an operand with it
  which is attached to a Vertex and is a batch of neuron activations/energies

DeepBeliefNetworkScheduler could be templatized on a class which does the algorithm steps
one actually runs the algorithm, launching kernels etc
one allocates temporary memory

that class has to have inline functions for allocating/freeing memory
which are stubs in the kernel launching impl
and call the memory allocator in the other one

so the memory allocator DbnDynamicMemoryAllocator
malloc( Edge e, int bufferi )
mfree( Edge e, int bufferi )

even better than that would be automatically allocating and freeing
need to know when is the last time a Vertex's neuron values are used
after that they can be freed


step through training process

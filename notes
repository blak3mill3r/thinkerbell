momentum
  new mem space weight_deltas, 3-buffers, still 3 for weight buffers too
  posprods (probability-deltas?)
  positive probability deltas:
    before positive phase:
      weight-delta-bufc element-wise reading bufb                    f(x) = x * momentum
    positive phase:
      weight_update, adding to contents of weight-delta-bufc:        f(x) = x + epsilonw*pos-probability-delta/batch_size
    negative phase:
      weight_update, subtracting from contents of weight-delta-bufc: f(x) = x - epsilonw*neg-probability-deltas/batch_size
    error kernel: element wise sum of (reality-fantasy)^2
    update
      weight decay, subtracting from contents of bufc                f(x) = x - epsilonw*weightcost*weight
      weight update, weight-bufc = weight-bufb + weight-delta-bufc
      

add a rms error kernel


















biases_memory_layout_map could be simplified to map<Vertex,int>
maybe weights_memory_layout_map too

little things
name changes
  vertex_ptr -> neurons_ptr
  DeepBeliefNetwork* -> DBN*
move all the DBN* classes into a namespace deep_belief_network

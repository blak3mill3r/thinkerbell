biases_memory_layout_map could be simplified to map<Vertex,int>
maybe weights_memory_layout_map too

little things
name changes
  vertex_ptr -> neurons_ptr
  DeepBeliefNetwork* -> DBN*
move all the DBN* classes into a namespace deep_belief_network



a picture of triple-buffering:

           |   |   |
           | A |---|
           |   |   |
           |---| B |
           |   |   |
           | C |---|
           |   |   |
           |---| A |
           |   |   |
           | B |---|
           |   |   |
   t0   -->|---| C |
           |   |   |
           | A |---|<--    t1
           |   |   |
   t2   -->|---| B |
           |   |   |

at t0
synch with A-exec-finished in other stream
up activate through graph
synch with C-exec-finished in other stream
positive weight adjust step, weights-C = weights-B + delta
2 ags steps
negative weight adjust step, weights-C = weights-C - delta
record A-exec-finished

at t1
synch with B-exec-finished in other stream
up activate through graph
synch with A-exec-finished in other stream
positive weight adjust step, weights-A = weights-C + delta
2 ags steps
negative weight adjust step, weights-A = weights-A - delta
